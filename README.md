# Stocks-Data-a-Python-Project-for-Data-Science
This project demonstrates Python skills in data analysis, web scraping, and visualization. Using Jupyter Notebook and libraries like pandas, yfinance, and BeautifulSoup, it models the role of a Data Scientist by building stock data dashboards.

ðŸ“Š Stocks Data â€“ A Python Project for Data Science

This repository contains a hands-on Python project focused on stock market data analysis. The project demonstrates core skills in Python programming, data analysis, and data visualization while simulating the role of a Data Scientist or Data Analyst.

Using Jupyter Notebook and popular Python libraries, you will:

Collect stock price and revenue data via web scraping and APIs.

Clean and structure data using Python data structures and pandas.

Build interactive visualizations and dashboards with Plotly.

Apply fundamental Python techniques for data exploration and storytelling.

ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

Perform web scraping in Python to obtain stock and revenue data.

Extract and clean datasets using Python libraries such as pandas, yfinance, and BeautifulSoup.

Apply Python fundamentals and data structures in a real-world context.

Create a simple dashboard to visualize stock trends and revenues.

This project reflects the workflow of a Data Scientist or Data Analyst â€” from data collection and preparation to analysis and visualization.
